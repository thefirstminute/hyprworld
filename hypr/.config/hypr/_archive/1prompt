I'm trying to make a perfect keyboard driven computer workflow using hyprland (with wayland, obviously)
https://wiki.hypr.land
installed 'on top of' cachy os. it seems they have some opinions too, maybe brief yourself with what they do/have installed:
https://wiki.cachyos.org
I've been inspired by omarchy, so look into that 'distro' I'll be trying to implement several things like they've done
https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual
https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/tree/master/config

I like lean minimal design/code.
Wherever possible just use tools that come 'for free' with the cachy install of hyprland.

I'm using a modular setup like:

source = ~/.config/hypr/vars.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/env.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/keys/init.conf
etc...

I have these set in my vars.conf file:

# Mod Keys
$mod = SUPER
$winMod = SUPER SHIFT
$modMod = SUPER SHIFT ALT
$sysMod = CTRL ALT
$launchMod = SUPER ALT
$superMod = CTRL SUPER ALT

# Set programs
$terminal = kitty
$editor = $terminal -e vim
$fileManager = thunar
$webBrowser = firefox
$menu = wofi --show drun

for testing new features I like to use this binding (I'll set my actual keybind after I know it's working)
bind = $sysMod, PERIOD, exec,

but for future actual commands I think we need to use:
bindd so we can add a description like:
bindd = $mod, SLASH, Change Split, togglesplit

notify needs a colour, apparently:
bindel = , XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%  && hyprctl notify -1 600 $colInfo "Volume" "▲"

remember the notify syntax, and the following variables in my vars.conf:
$colMain = "rgba(00ff99ee)"
$colSecond = "rgba(33ccffee)"
$colAccent = "rgba(00ff99ee)"

$colSuccess = "rgba(00ff99ee)"
$colWarn = "rgb(d20f39)"
$colInfo = "rgba(33ccffee)"
$colInactive = "rgba(595959aa)"

I have a scripts directory and I call scripts as:
bindd = $sysMod, PERIOD, Testing Command, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/keybind-search.sh
